## Goal/Purpose

### Personal Need

I've been reading alot more lately and I found myself wanting a tool to help me keep track of that. So I decided to build this project called tomelog, to help me record the books I read as well as log my progress with each of them.

### Practice Software Architecture

Currently I am looking for an entry level software engineering position and through a series of applications I found one skill consitently in the prerequisites, architect/design robust software applications. I felt myself not feeling confident in my abilities to do so and not understanding whether I was building robust software applications or not. Through a youtube channel (ByteByteGo) that I follow I was able to find a book that covered exactly this topic, the book was Clean Architecture by Rober C. Martin.

So in order to build up my abilities and a programmer I used this project as an oppurtunity to help me better my skills in designing robust software applications.

### Practice being a Pragmatic Programmer

Prior to this project I found myself writting out alot of specs and documentation for how a application should work. Unfortuantly, all my planning for those previous projects was for naught because I would change things or sometimes my plans wouldn't account for future issues or things would pop up that I never anticipated. Needless to say my previous development process was hindering.

I've recently finished a book with the title of The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. The book covered alot of tips on how to develop software and I wanted to practice those tips. So, I took this project as an oppurtunity to do so.

Some of the tips I found myself consitently using during the development of this project are the following.

- Tracer bullets
- Engineering Daybooks
- Design by Contract
- Assertive Programming
- Transforming Programming
- Programming by Coincidence
- Naming Things
- Coconuts Don't Cut It
